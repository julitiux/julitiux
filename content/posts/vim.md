## vim like a lenguage
Using vim is a different experience than usgin any other code editor. You have to use the next sintax

`verb - modifier - object`

Verbs
* v - visual
* c - change
* d - delete
* y - yank, copy

Modifier
* i - inside
* a - around
* t - till
* f - find
* / - search

Objects
* w - word
* s - sentence
* p - paragraph
* b - block
* t - tag (html)

## Let's talk vim
Now that we are in normal mode we can talk to vim.

You don't press everything at once you do it letter by letter.

Delete the word where the cursor is
```code
diw - delete inside word
```
Change the sentense you are on
```code
cis - change inside sentence
```
Change what is inside the quotes
```code
ci" - change inside quote
```
Change anything up to 'foo'
```code
c/foo - change search foo
```
Change everything up to the letter X
```code
ctX - change till X
```

When we have finished editing the file, in `normal` mode:

__save__
```code
:w
```
__exit__
```code
:q
```
__save and exit__
```code
:wq
```
__exit without save the changes__

# 11. Registers.

There are 9 types of registers:
1. The unnamed register ""
2. 10 numbered register "0 to "9
3. The small delete register "-
4. 26 named registers "a to "z or "A to "Z
5. 4 read-only registers ":, "., "% and "#
6. The expression register "=
7. The selection and drop registers "\*, "+ and "~
8. The black hole register "_
9. Last search pattern register "/

To access register's vim is simple, just specify the register like this
```code
"{register}
```

### use the register `a` and copy a word like this
```code
"ayiw
```
### to acces the register has to do this:
```code
"ap
```
copy and paste the content of the register `a`
### access the content deleted
```code
""
```
## Other registers
### the black hole register
```code
#_
```
### the system clipboard
```code
"+ / "*
```

# 12. Thre power of macros

## Record and execute a macro
Macros start recording as soon as we press the `q` key and assign a record to it. To stop recording we will press `q` again.
### start to record a macro
```code
q
```
### end to record a macro
```code
q
```
### start to record a macro with register
```code
q{letter's register}
```
### execute a macro
```code
@{letter's register}
```

## variables
### declare a variable
```code
:let {variable}={number}
:ley i=1
```
### you can modify the variable even inside the macro
```code
let i+=1
```
### execute a macro in parallel (visual mode)
```code
:'<,'> normal @{letter's macro}
```
### lets paste the content of variable (insert mode)
```code
<ctrl-r>=i
```

## tricks
### for macros use commands like `A` and `I` just for normalize the position of cursor
### to repeat a macro just we have will use `@@` as many times as we want
