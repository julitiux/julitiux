# Spock Primer

## Imports

```groovy
import spock.lang.*
```

## Specification
```groovy
class MyFirstSpecification extends Specification {
  // fields
  // fixture methods
  // feature methods
  // helper methods
}
```

## Fields
Its a good practice to initialice them right at the point of declaration.
```groovy
def obj = new ClassUnderSpecification()
def coll = new Collaborator()
```

Somethimes you need to share an object between methods; declare `@Shared` field. This es equivalent to initializing the field at the very beginning of the `setupSpec()` method.
```groovy
@Shared res = new VeryExpensiveResource()
```

Static field should only for constants.
```groovy
static final PI = 3.141592654
```

## Fixture Methods
```groovy
def setupSpec() {}    // runs once - before the first feature method
def setup() {}        // runs before every feature method
def cleanup() {}      // runs after every feature method
def cleanupSpec() {}  // runs once - after the last feature method
```
> **_NOTE:_**  They may only one fixture method of each type per specification class

### Invocation order

1. super.stupSpec
2. sub.setupSpec
3. super.setup
4. sub.setup
5. feature.method
6. sub.cleanup
7. super.cleanup
8. sub.cleanupSpec
9. super.cleanupSpec

## Feature Methods
Conceptually, a feature method consists of four phases:
1. Set up the feature's fixture
2. Provide a _stimulus_ to the system under specification
3. Describe the _response_ expected from the system
4. Clean up the feature's fixture

```groovy
def "pushing an element on the stack"() {
  // blocks go here
}
```

### Blocks
1. given
2. when
3. then
4. expect
5. cleanup
6. where

### Given blocks
```groovy
given:
  def stack = new Stack()
  def elem = "push me"
```

### When and Then Blocks
```groovy
when:       // stimulus
then:       // response
```

#### Conditions
```groovy
when:
  stack.push(elem)

then:
  !stack.empty
  stack.size() == 1
  stack.peek() == elem)
```

> **_TIP:_** Try to keep the number of conditions per feature method small.

#### Implicit and explicit conditions
```groovy
def setup(){
  stack = new Stack()
  assert stack.empty
}
```

#### Excepion Conditions
```groovy
when:
  stack.pop()

then:
  thrown(EmptyStackException)
  stack.empty
```

```groovy
when:
  stack.pop()

then:
  def e = thrown(EmptyStackException)
  e.cause == null
```

```groovy
when:
  stack.pop()

then:
  EmptyStackException e = thrown()
  e.cause == null
```

```groovy
def "HashMap accepts null key"() {
  given:
    def map = new HashMap()

  when:
    map.put(null, "elem")

  then:
    notThrown(NullPointerException)
}
```

### Interactions
Whereas conditions decribe an object's state, interactions describe how objects communicate with each other.

```groovy
def "events are published to all subscribers"() {
  given:
    def subscriber1 = Mock(Subscriber)
    def subscriber2 = Mock(Subscriber)
    def publisher = new Publisher()
    publisher.add(subscriber1)
    publisher.add(subscriber2)

  when:
    publisher.fire("event")

  then:
    1 * subscriber1.receive("event")
    1 * subscriber2.receive("event")
}
```

### Expect Block
An expect block is more limited than a `then` block in that may only contain conditions and variable definitions.
Compare the following two attempts to describe the Math.max() method:
```groovy
when:
  def x = Math.max(1, 2)

then:
  x == 2
```

by this one:
```groovy
expecto:
  Math.max(1,2) == 2
```

Although both snippets are semantically equivalent, the secont one is crearly preferable. As a guidelan, use `when-then` to describe methods with side effects, and `expect` to describe purely dunctional methods.

### Clean Blocks
A cleanup block may only be followed by a `where` block, and may not be repeated. Like a cleanup method, is is used to free many resources used by a feature method, and is run even if teh feature has producedan exception.
```grooovy
given:
  def file = new File("/some/path")
  file.createNewFile()

  // ...

cleanup:
  file.delete()
```

### Where blocks
A `where` block always come last in a method, and may not be repeated. It is used to write data-driven feature methods.

```groovy
def "computing the maximum of two numbers"() {
  expect:
    Math.max(a, b) == c

  where:
    a << [5, 3]
    b << [1, 9]
    c << [5, 9]
}
```

## Helper Methods
Sometimes feature methods grow large and/or contains lots of duplicate code. In such case it can make sense to introduce one o more helper methods. Two good candidates for helper methods are setup/cleanup logic and complex condition
```groovy
def "offered PC matches preferred configuration"() {
  when:
    def pc = shop.buyPc()

  then:
    pc.vendor == "Sunny"
    pc.clockRate >= 2333
    pc.ram >= 4096
    pc.os == "Linux"
}
```

If you happend to be a computer geek, you preferred PC configuration mught be very detailed, ou you might want to compare offers from many different shops
```groovy
def "offered PC matches preferred configuration"() {
  when:
    def pc = shop.buyPc()

  then:
    matchesPreferredConfiguration(pc)
}

def matchesPreferredConfiguration(pc) {
  pc.vendor == "Sunny"
  && pc.clockRate >= 2333
  && pc.ram >= 4096
  && pc.os == "Linux"
}
```.

The helper method matchesPreferredConfiguration() consists of a single boolean expression whose result is returned:

```groovy
Condition not satisfied:

matchesPreferredConfiguration(pc)
|                             |
false                         ...
```

No very helpful. Fortunately, we can do better:
```groovy
void matchesPreferredConfiguration(pc) {
  assert pc.vendor == "Sunny"
  assert pc.clockRate >= 2333
  assert pc.ram >= 4096
  assert pc.os == "Linux"
}
```

## Using `with` for expectations
As an alternative to the above helper methods, you can use with(target, closure) method to interact on the object being verified.
```groovy
def "offered PC matches preferred configuration"() {
  when:
    def pc = shop.buyPc()

  then:
    with(pc) {
      vendor == "Sunny"
      clockRate >= 2333
      ram >= 406
      os == "Linux"
    }
```

Unlike when you helper methods, there is no need for explicit assert statements for proper error reporting
When verifying mocks, a `with` statement can also cut out verbose verification statements

```groovy
def service = Mock(Service) // has start(), stop(), and doWork() methods
def app = new Application(service) // controls the lifecycle of the service

when:
  app.run()

then:
  with(service) {
    1 * start()
    1 * doWork()
    1 * stop()
  }
```

## Using `verifyAll` to assert multiple expecations together
Normal exprectations fail the test on the first failed assertions. Sometimes it is helpful to collect these failures before failling the test more information, this behavior is also know as soft assertions
```groovy
def "offered PC matches preferred configuration"() {
  when:
    def pc = shop.buyPc()

  then:
    verifyAll(pc) {
      vendor == "Sunny"
      clockRate >= 2333
      ram >= 406
      os == "Linux"
    }
}
```

or can be used without a target
```groovy
expect:
  verifyAll {
    2 == 2
    4 == 4
  }
```

## Specifications as Documentations
Well-written specifications are a valuable source of information. Especially for higher-level specifications targeting a wider audience than just developers, it makes sense to provide more information in natural languaje than just the names specifications and features. Therefore, Spock provides a way to attach textual descriptions to blocks.

```groovy
given: "open a database connection"
// code goes here
```

Use the `and:` label to describe logically different parts of a block
```groovy
given: "open a database connection"
// code goes here

and: "seed the customer table"
// code goes here

and: "seed the product table"
// code goes here
```

An and: label followed by a description can be inserted at any (top-level) position of a feature method, without altering the methodâ€™s semantics.

In Behavior Driven Development, customer-facing features (called stories) are described in a given-when-then format. Spock directly supports this style of specification with the given: label:
```groovy
given: "an empty bank account"
// ...

when: "the account is credited \$10"
// ...

then: "the account's balance is \$10"
// ...
```
## Extensions
As we have seen, Spock offers lots of functionality for writing specifications. However, there always comes a time when something else is needed. Therefore, Spock provides an interception-based extension mechanism. Extensions are activated by annotations called directives. Currently, Spock ships with the following directives:

|             |    |
| ----------- | -- |
| @Timeout    | Sets a timeout for execution of a feature of fixture method |
| @Ignore     | Ignores any feature method carrying this annotation |
| @IgnoreRest | Any feature method carrying this annotations will be executed, all others will be ignored. Useful for quickly running just a single method |
| @FailsWith  | Expects a feature method to complete abruptly. @FailsWith has two use cases: First, to document known bugs that cannot be resolved immediately. Second, to replace exception conditions in certain corner cases where the latter cannot be used (like specifying the behavior of exception conditions). In all other cases, exception conditions are preferable |
