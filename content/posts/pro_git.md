# Getting Started

## Installing Git
### Installing on Linux

If you want ton install the basic Git tools on Linux via a binary installer

```terminal
sudo dfn install git-all
```

If you are on a Debian-based distribution, such a Ubuntu, try _apt_

```terminal
sudo apt install git-all
```

### Installing on macOS

The easiest is probably to install the Xcode Command Line Tools. On Mavericks (10.9) above you can do this simply by trying to run _git_ from the Terminal the very first time.

```terminal
git --version
```

If you don't have it installed already, it will prompt you to install it.

If you want a more up to date version, you can also install it via a binary installer. A macOS Git installer is maintained and available for download at the Git website, at [https://git-scm.com/download/mac](https://git-scm.com/download/mac).

### Installing on Windows

The are also a few ways to install Git on Windows.

The most official build is available for download on the Git website: [https://git-scm.com/download/win](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
