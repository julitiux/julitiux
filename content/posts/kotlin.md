# **INDEX**

# 1. Your first kotlin application

# 2. Variables, Constants, and Types.

You use _variables_ and _constants_ ti store values and pass data around in your application.

## Declaring a Variable

You defines a variable using the keyword var, which indicates that you want to declare a new variable, followed by the new variable's name.

Next, you specified the type definition for the variable. : Int.

Last, you used th _assignment operator_ (=) to assign what is on the righthand.

```kotlin
var variableName : Int = 5
```

## Kotlin's Built-In Tyoes

|Type|Description|Examples|
|---|---|---|
|String|Textual Data|"Text"|
|Char|Single character|'x' Unicode character U+0041|
|Boolean|True/False values|true / false|
|Int|Whole numbers| 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0|
|Double|Decimal numbers|3.14, 2.10|
|List|Collections of Elements|[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0]|
|Set|Collections of _unique_ elements|[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0]|
|Map|Collections of key-value pairs|"small" to 5.99, "medium" to 7.99, "large" to 10.99|

## Read-Only Variables

Kotlin provides a different syntaxis for declaring _read-only_ variables - variables that cannot be modified once they are addigned.

To declare a read-only variable, you use the **val** keyword.

## Type Inference

Notice that the type definitions you specified for the playerName and experiencePoints variables are grayed out in IntelliJ. Grayed-out text indicates an element that is not required.

```kotlin
val playerName : _String_ = "Estragon"
```

Kotlin includes a feature called _type inference_ that allows you to omit the type definition for the variable that are assigned a value when are declared. Because you assign data of the String type to playerName and of the Int type to experiencePoints when you declare them, the kotlin compiler infers the appropriate type information for both variables.

## Inspecting Kotlin Bytecode

Press the Shift key twice to open the Search Everywhere dialog. Begin entering "show kotling bytecode" in the search box, and select Show Kotlin Bytecode from the list of available actions when it appears.

You can also open the tool window with Tools => Kotlin => Show Kotlin Bytecode.

## Common functions in Kotlin

```kotlin
  val emptyList = emptyList<Int>()
  println("emptyList.any() is ${emptyList.any()}")

  val nonEmptyList = listOf<Int>(1, 2, 3)
  println("nonEmptyList.any() is ${nonEmptyList.any()}")
```

```kotlin
  val numbers = listOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0)
  val firstOdd = numbers.find { it % 2 == 0 }
  val firstLast = numbers.findLast { it % 2 == 0 }
```

```kotlin
  val strings : List<String> = listOf("12a", "45", "", "3")
  val ints: List<Int> = strings.mapNotNull { it.toIntOrNull() }
  println(ints) // [45, 3]
  println(ints.sum()) // 48
```

```kotlin
  val map = mapOf("Alice" to 20, "Tom" to 13, "Bob" to 18 )
  val adults = map.mapNotNull { (name, age) -> name.takeIf { age >= 18 } }
  println(adults) // [Alice, Bob]
```

# 3. Conditionals

This lenguage feature is called _control flow_, and it allows yoy yo describe the conditions for when specific portions of your program should run.

Tip: Add a **main** entry point function to _program_kt_ by typing "main" and pressing the Tab key. Your function should look like this:


```kotlin
fun main(args: Array<String>){
	...
}
```

### Listing 3.1 Printing the playerâ€™s health condition (Game.kt)
```kotlin
fun main(args: Array<String>) {
>>    val name = "Madrigal"
>>    var healthPoints = 100
>>    if (healthPoints == 100) {
>>        println(name + " is in excellent condition!")
>>    } else {
>>        println(name + " is in awful condition!")
>>    }
}
```

You express this with the == _structural equality operator_. It can be read as "is equal to", so this statement reads "if healthPoint is equals to 100".

Using the addition operator (+) to append a value to a string is called _string concatenation_. It is an easy way to customize what is printed to the conole based on the value of variable.

### Table 3.1 Comparison operators

|Operator|Description|
|---|---|
|< |Evaluates whether the value on the left is less than the value on the right|
|<=|Evaluates whether the value on the left is less than or equal to the value on the right|
|> |Evaluates whether the value on the left is greater than the value on the right|
|>=|Evaluates whether the value on the left is greater than or equal to the value on the right|
|==|Evaluates whether the value on the left is equal to the value on the right|
|!=|Evaluates whether the value on the left is not equal to the value on the right|
|===|Evaluates whether the two instances point to the same reference|
|!==|Evaluates whether the two instances do not point to the same reference|

Back to business. Run Game.tk by clicking the run button to the left of the **main** function.

You can included a code _comment_, indicated by //

```kotlin
// This is a comment
```

Anything to the right of // is included in the comment and is ignored by the compiler, so you can use any syntaxys you want there.

### Listing 3.2 Modifying healthPoints (Game.kt)
```kotlin
fun main(args: Array<String>) { 
    val name = "Madrigal"
<<  var healthPoints = 100
>>  var healthPoints = 89
    if (healthPoints == 100) {
        println(name + " is in excellent condition!")
    } else {
        println(name + " is in awful condition!")
    }
}
```

### Listing 3.3 Checking for more player conditions (Game.kt)
```kotlin
fun main(args: Array<String>) {
    val name = "Madrigal"
    var healthPoints = 89
    if (healthPoints == 100) {
        println(name + " is in excellent condition!")
>>  } else if (healthPoints >= 90) { println(name + " has a few scratches.")
>>  } else if (healthPoints >= 75) {
>>      println(name + " has some minor wounds.")
>>  } else if (healthPoints >= 15) {
>>      println(name + " looks pretty hurt.")
    } else {
        println(name + " is in awful condition!")
    }
}
```

### Listing 3.4 Checking for blessedness (Game.kt)
```kotlin
fun main(args: Array<String>) {
    val name = "Madrigal"
    var healthPoints = 89
>>  val isBlessed = true

        if (healthPoints == 100) {
            println(name + "is in excellent condition!")
        } else if (healthPoints >= 90) {
            println(name + " has a few scratches.")
        } else if (healthPoints >= 75) {
>>          if (isBlessed) {
>>              println(name + " has some minor wounds but is healing quite quickly!")
>>          } else {
                println(name + " has some minor wounds.")
            }
        } else if (healthPoints >= 15) {
            println(name + " looks pretty hurt.")
        } else {
            println(name + " is in awful condition!")
        }
}
```

### Listing 3.5 Using logical operators in a conditional (Game.kt)
```kotlin
fun main(args: Array<String>) {
    val name = "Madrigal"
    var healthPoints = 89
    val isBlessed = true
>>  val isImmortal = false

>>  // Aura
>>  if (isBlessed && healthPoints > 50 || isImmortal) {
>>      println("GREEN")
>>  } else {
>>      println("NONE")
>>  }

    if (healthPoints == 100) {
        ...
    }
}
```

### Table 3.2 Logical operator

|Operator|Description|
|---|---|
|&&|Logical 'and' : true if and only if both are true (false otherwise)|
|'||'|Logical 'or' : true if either is true (false only if both are false)|
|!|Logical 'not' : true becomes false, false becomes true|

Incidentally, if you tired of keeping your code nicely indented as you make changes. IntelliJ is here to help. Select Code => Auto-Ident Lines and enjoy the simple pleasure of clean idents.


### Listing 3.6 Using logical operators in the declaration of a variable (Game.kt)
```kotlin
fun main(args: Array<String>) {
    ...
    // Aura
<<  if (isBlessed && healthPoints > 50 || isImmortal) {
>>  val auraVisible = isBlessed && healthPoints > 50 || isImmortal
>>  if (auraVisible) {
        println("GREEN")
    } else {
        println("NONE")
    }
    ... 
}
```

### Listing 3.7 Using a conditional expression (Game.kt)
```kotlin
fun main(args: Array<String>) {
    ...
<<  if (healthPoints == 100) {
>>    val healthStatus = if (healthPoints == 100) {
>>        println(name + "is in excellent condition!")
        "is in excellent condition!"
    } else if (healthPoints >= 90) {
<<      println(name + " has a few scratches.")
>>      "has a few scratches."
    } else if (healthPoints >= 75) {
    if (isBlessed) {
<<      println(name + " has some minor wounds but is healing quite quickly!")
>>      "has some minor wounds but is healing quite quickly!"
        } else {
<<          println(name + " has some minor wounds.")
>>          "has some minor wounds."
        }
    } else if (healthPoints >= 15) {
<<      println(name + " looks pretty hurt.")
>>      "looks pretty hurt."
    } else {
<<      println(name + " is in awful condition!")
>>      "is in awful condition!"
    }
>>  // Player status
>>  println(name + " " + healthStatus)
}
```


### Listing 3.8 Improving aura code with a conditional expression (Game.kt)
```kotlin
...
// Aura
val auraVisible = isBlessed && healthPoints > 50 || isImmortal 
<<  if (auraVisible) {
<<      println("GREEN")
<<  } else {
<<      println("NONE")
<<  }
>>  val auraColor = if (auraVisible) "GREEN" else "NONE" 
>>  println(auraColor)
...
```

## Ranges

Kotlin provides _ranges_ to represent a lineas seriesof values.

The .. operator, as in in 1..5, signals a range. A range includes all values from the value on the leftof the .. operator to the value on teh rigth, so 1..5 includes 1,2,3,4 and 5. Ranges can also be a sequence of characteres.

You use the _in_ keyword to check whether a value is within a range.

### Listing 3.9 Refactoring healthStatus with ranges(Game.kt)
```kotlin
fun main(args: Array<String>) {
    ...
    val healthStatus = if (healthPoints == 100) {
            "is in excellent condition!"
<<      } else if (healthPoints >= 90) {
>>      } else if (healthPoints in 90..99) {
            "has a few scratches."
<<      } else if (healthPoints >= 75) {
>>      } else if (healthPoints in 75..89) {
            if (isBlessed) {
                "has some minor wounds but is healing quite quickly!"
            } else {
                "has some minor wounds."
            }
<<      } else if (healthPoints >= 15) {
>>      } else if (healthPoints in 15..74) {
            "looks pretty hurt."
        } else {
            "is in awful condition!"
        }
}
```


## when Expressions

Then when espression is another control flow mechanism available in Kotlin. Like if/else, the when expression allows you to write conditions to check for and will execute corresponding code when the condition evaluates as true. when provides a more concise syntaxis and is an especially good fit for conditionals with three or more branches.


```kotlin
val race = "gnaome"
val faction = when (race) {
	"dwarf" -> "Keepers of the Mines"
	"gnome" -> "Keepers of the Mines"
	"orc" -> "Free people of the Rolling Hills"
	"human" -> "Free people of the Rolling Hills"
}
```
First, a val is declared, race. Next, a second val is declared: faction, whose value isdetermined with a when expression. The expression checks tha value of race against each of the values on the lefthand side of the -> operator (called the arrow), and when it finds a match it assigns faction the value on the righthand side. (-> is used differently in other langaujes -- and, is has other uses in Kotlin, as you will see later) 

A practical rule of thumb is that a when expression should replace an if/else expression if your code includes an else if branch.

A when expression work similarly to an if/else expression in that you define conditions and branches that are executed if a conditions is true. when is different in that it _scopes_ the lefthand side of the condition automatically to whatever you provide as an argument to when.

By the way, were you wondering abut the nested if/else in one branch of your when expression? This pattern is not very common, but Kotlin's when expression gives you all of flexibility that you need to implement it.

## Listing 3.10 Refactoring healthStatus with when (Game.kt)

```kotlin
fun main(args: Array<String>) {
    ...
<<  val healthStatus = if (healthPoints == 100) {
<<          "is in excellent condition!"
<<      } else if (healthPoints in 90..99) {
<<          "has a few scratches."
<<      } else if (healthPoints in 75..89) {
<<          if (isBlessed) {
<<              "has some minor wounds but is healing quite quickly!"
<<          } else {
<<              "has some minor wounds."
<<          }
<<      } else if (healthPoints in 15..74) {
<<          "looks pretty hurt."
<<      } else {
<<          "is in awful condition!"
<<      }

>>    val healthStatus = when (healthPoints) {
>>        100 -> "is in excellent condition!"
>>        in 90..99 -> "has a few scratches."
>>        in 75..89 -> if (isBlessed) {
>>            "has some minor wounds but is healing quite quickly!"
>>        } else {
>>            "has some minor wounds."
>>        }
>>        in 15..74 -> "looks pretty hurt."
>>        else -> "is in awful condition!"
>>    }
}
```


## String Templates

You have seen that a string can be built up with the values of variables and even the results of conditional expressions. Kotlin features _string templates_ to aid in this common need and, again, make your code more readable. Templates allow you to include the value of a variable inside a strig's quotation marks.


```kotlin
println (name + " " + otherVariable)
println ("$name $otherVariable")
```

## Listing 3.11 Using a string template (Game.kt)

```kotlin
fun main(args: Array<String>) {
    ...
    // Player status
<<  println(name + " " + healthStatus)
>>  println("$name $healthStatus")
}
```

This special symbol indicates to Kotlin that you would be like to template a val o var within a string you define, and it is provided as a convenience. Note that these templated values appeat inside the quotation marks that define the string.

Kotlin also allow you to evaluate an expression within a string and _interpolate_ the result -- that is, to insert the result into to string. Any expression that you add within the curl braces after a dollar-sign character (${}) will be evaluated as a part of the string. Add a report of the player's blessedness and aura color to the player status display to see how this works.

## Listing 3.12 Formatting the isBlessed status with a string expression (Game.kt)
```kotlin
fun main(args: Array<String>) {
    ...
    // Aura
    val auraVisible = isBlessed && healthPoints > 50 || isImmortal 
    val auraColor = if (auraVisible) "GREEN" else "NONE" 
<<  print(auraColor)
    ...
    // Player status
>>  println("(Aura: $auraColor) " +
>>          "(Blessed: ${if (isBlessed) "YES" else "NO"})")
        println("$name $healthStatus")
}
```

# 4. Functions

A _function_ is a reausable portion of code that accomplishes a specific task.

Control-click (click-right) on the code you selected and choose Refactor -> Extract -> Function...

## Anatomy of a Function

A function consist of a function header and function body


```kotlin
private fun formatHealthStatus(healhPoints: Int, isBlessed: Boolean): String {
	return healthStatus
}
```

## Function header

This first part of function is the function header. The function header is made up of five parts. the visibility modifier, function declaration keyword, function name , function parametert, and return type


```kotlin

private fun formatHealthStatus(healthPoint: Int, isBlessed Boolean); String{
    return healthStatus
}

// visibility modifier
private

// function declatartion keyword
fun

// function name 
formatHealthStatus

// function parameters
healthPoint: Int, isBlessed Boolean

//return type
String
```

## Listing4.1 Adding a castFireball function (Game.kt)

```kotlin
...
    private fun auraColor(isBlessed: Boolean,
                        healthPoints: Int,
                        isImmortal: Boolean): String {
        val auraVisible = isBlessed && healthPoints > 50 || isImmortal
        val auraColor = if (auraVisible) "GREEN" else "NONE"
        return auraColor
    }

>>  private fun castFireball() {
>>      println("A glass of Fireball springs into existence.")
>>  }
```

## Listing 4.2 Calling castFireball (Game.kt)
```kotlin
fun main(args: Array<String>) {
    ...
    // Player status
    printPlayerStatus(auraColor, isBlessed, name, healthStatus)
>>  castFireball()
} ...
```

## Listing 4.3 Adding a numFireballs parameter (Game.kt)
```kotlin
fun main(args: Array<String>) {
    ...
    // Player status
    printPlayerStatus(auraColor, isBlessed, name, healthStatus)
<<  castFireball()
>>  castFireball(5)
}
...
<<  private fun castFireball() {
>>  private fun castFireball(numFireballs: Int) {
<<      println("A glass of Fireball springs into existence.")
>>        println("A glass of Fireball springs into existence. (x$numFireballs)")
}
```
## Default Arguments

### Listing 4.4 Giving the numFireballs parameter a default value(Game.kt)
```kotlin
fun main(args: Array<String>) {
    ...
    // Player status
    printPlayerStatus(auraColor, isBlessed, name, healthStatus)
    castFireball(5)
}
...
<<  private fun castFireball(numFireballs: Int) {
>>  private fun castFireball(numFireballs: Int = 2) {
        println("A glass of Fireball springs into existence. (x$numFireballs)")
    }
```


### Listing 4.5 Using castFireballâ€™s default argument value (Game.kt)
```kotlin
fun main(args: Array<String>) {
    ...
    // Player status
    printPlayerStatus(auraColor, isBlessed, name, healthStatus)

<<  castFireball(5)
>>  castFireball()
} 
...
```


### Listing 4.6 Using optional single-expression function syntax (Game.kt)
```kotlin
    ...
<<  private fun formatHealthStatus(healthPoints: Int, isBlessed: Boolean): String {
<<      val healthStatus = when (healthPoints) {
>>  private fun formatHealthStatus(healthPoints: Int, isBlessed: Boolean) =
>>          when (healthPoints) {
                100 -> "is in excellent condition!"
                in 90..99 -> "has a few scratches."
                in 75..89 -> if (isBlessed) {
                    "has some minor wounds, but is healing quite quickly!"
                } else {
                    "has some minor wounds."
                }
                in 15..74 -> "looks pretty hurt."
                else -> "is in awful condition!"
            }
<<      return healthStatus
<<  }
    ...
<<  private fun castFireball(numFireballs: Int = 2)  {
>>  private fun castFireball(numFireballs: Int = 2) =
        println("A glass of Fireball springs into existence. (x$numFireballs)")
<<  }
```

## Unit Functions

Not all functions return a value. Some use side effects instead to do their work, like modifying the state of a variable or calling other functions that yield system output.

```kotlin
private fun castFireball(numFireballs: Int = 2) = 
    println("A glass of Fireball springs into existence. (x$numFireballs)")
```

Kotlin uses the _Unit_ return type to signify exactly this: a function that returns no value. If the return keyword is not used, it is implicit that the return type for that function is Unit.

## Named Function Aguments

Take a look at how you call the printPlayerStatus function, passing arguments as parameters:

```kotling
printPlayerStatus("NONE", true, "Mandrigal", status)
```

Another way you could call the same function is:

```kotlin
printPlayerStatus(auraColor = "NONE",
                  isBlessed = true,
                  name = "Mandrigal",
                  healthStatus = status)
```

This optional syntax uses a _named function arguments_ and is an alternative way to provide arguments to a function. Using named arguments frees you to pass the argument to the function in whatever order you would like. For example, you could also call *printPlayerStatus like this:

```kotlin
printPlayerStatus(healthStatus = status,
                  auraColor = "NONE",
                  name = "Mandrigal",
                  isBlessed = true)
```

# 5. Anonymous Functions and the Function Type

Functions defined without a name, called _anonymous functions_, are similar, with two major differences: Anonymous functions have no name as part of their definition, an they interact with the rest of your code a little different in that they are commonly passed to or returned from other functions.

## Anonymous Functions

An anonymous function lets you describe additional rules for a standar library function so that you can customize its behavior.

One of meny functions in teh standard library is __count__. When called on a string, __count__ return the total number of letters in the string. The following code counts the letters in the string "Mississippi"

```kotlin
val numLetters = "Mississippi".count()
println(numLetters)
// Prints 11
```

But what if you wanted to count only a specific character in "Mississippi, say the letter "s". the kotlin standard library allows you to provide rules to the __count__ function to determine whether a letter should be counted. You describe the rules for the function by providing an anonymous function as an argument:

```kotlin
val numLetters = "Mississippi".count({ letter ->
    letter == 's'
})
println(numLetters)
// Prints 4
```

### Listing 5.1 Defining an anonymous greeting function (SimVillage.kt)
```kotlin
fun main(args: Array<String>) {
    println({
        val currentYear = 2018
        "Welcome to SimVillage, Mayor! (copyright $currentYear)"
    }())
}
```

Outside the anonymous function's closing brace, you call function with a pair of empty parentheses.

## The function type

Anonymous functions also have a type, called the __function type__. Variables of the function type can hold an anonymous function as their value, and the function can then be passed around your code like any other variable.

### Listing 5.2 Assigning the anonymous function to a variable (SimVillage.kt)
```kotlin
fun main(args: Array<String>) {
<<  println({
>>  val greetingFunction: () -> String = {
>>      val currentYear = 2018
>>      "Welcome to SimVillage, Mayor! (copyright $currentYear)"
>>  }
<<  })()
    println(greetingFunction())
}
```

### Figure 5.1 Function type sintaxis
```kotlin
    fun greetingFunction():   String
                        v       v
                        () -> String 
```
A function type definition consists of two parts: the function's parameters, in parentheses, followed by its return type, delimited by the arrow (->), as show in Figure 5.1

## Implicit returns

Maybe you have noticed that there is no return keyword within the anonymous function you defined:
```kotlin
    val greeetingFunction: () -> String = {
        val currentYear = 2018
        "Welcome to SimVillage, Mayor (copyrigth $currentYear)"
    }
```

## Function arguments

Like a named function, an anonymous function can accept zero, one or multiple argument of any type. The parameters an anonymous function accepts are indicated by type in the function type definition and then named in the anonymous functions's definition.

### Listing5.3 Adding a playerName parameter to the anonymous function (SimVillage.kt)
```kotlin
fun main(args: Array<String>) {
<<  val greetingFunction: () -> String = {
>>  val greetingFunction: (String) -> String = { playerName ->
        val currentYear = 2018
<<      "Welcome to SimVillage, Mayor! (copyright $currentYear)"
>>      "Welcome to SimVillage, $playerName! (copyright $currentYear)"
    }
<<  println(greetingFunction())
>>  println(greetingFunction("Guyal"))
}

## The it keyword

When defining anonymous functions that accept exactly one argument, the it keyword is available as a convenient alternative to specifying the parameter name.

### Listing 5.4 Using the it keyword (SimVillage.kt)
```kotlin
fun main(args: Array<String>) {
<<  val greetingFunction: (String) -> String = { playerName ->
>>  val greetingFunction: (String) -> String = {
        val currentYear = 2018
<<      "Welcome to SimVillage, $playerName! (copyright $currentYear)"
>>      "Welcome to SimVillage, $it! (copyright $currentYear)"
    }
    println(greetingFunction("Guyal"))
}
```

## Acceptig multiple arguments
While the _it_ syntaxis is available for an anonymous function that accept one argument, it is not allowed when there is more than one argument, However, anonymous functions can certainly accept multiplen named arguments.

### Listing 5.5 Accepting a second argument (SimVillage.kt)
```kotlin
fun main(args: Array<String>) {
<<  val greetingFunction: (String) -> String = {
>>  val greetingFunction: (String, Int) -> String = { playerName, numBuildings ->
        val currentYear = 2018
>>      println("Adding $numBuildings houses")
<<      "Welcome to SimVillage, $it! (copyright $currentYear)"
>>      "Welcome to SimVillage, $playerName! (copyright $currentYear)"
    }
<<  println(greetingFunction("Guyal"))
>>  println(greetingFunction("Guyal", 2))
}
```

## Type inference Support
Kotlin's type inference rules behave exactly the same with function types as they do with the types you met earlier in thie book: If a variabe is given an anonymous function as its value when it is declared no explicit tyoe definition is needed.

### Listing 5.6 Using type inference for greetingFunction (SimVillage.kt)
```kotlin
fun main() {
<<  val greetingFunction: (String, Int) -> String = { playerName, numBuildings ->
>>  val greetingFunction = { playerName: String, numBuildings: Int ->
        val currentYear = 2018
        println("Adding $numBuildings houses")
        "Welcome to SimVillage, $playerName! (copyright $currentYear)"
    }
    println(greetingFunction("Guyal", 2))
}
```

## Defining a Function that accpets a function

The book refers to anonymous functions as lambdas and their definitions as lambda expressions.

### Listing 5.7 Adding the runSimulation function (SimVillage.kt)
```kotlin
fun main(args: Array<String>) {
    val greetingFunction = { playerName: String, numBuildings: Int ->
        val currentYear = 2018
        println("Adding $numBuildings houses")
        "Welcome to SimVillage, $playerName! (copyright $currentYear)"
    }
<<  println(greetingFunction("Guyal", 2))
>>  runSimulation("Guyal", greetingFunction)
}

>>  fun runSimulation(playerName: String, greetingFunction: (String, Int) -> String) {
>>      val numBuildings = (1..3).shuffled().last()   // Randomly selects 1, 2, or 3
>>      println(greetingFunction(playerName, numBuildings))
>>  } 
```
