# Spock Primer

## Imports

```groovy
import spock.lang.*
```

## Specification
```groovy
class MyFirstSpecification extends Specification {
  // fields
  // fixture methods
  // feature methods
  // helper methods
}
```

## Fields
Its a good practice to initialice them right at the point of declaration.
```groovy
def obj = new ClassUnderSpecification()
def coll = new Collaborator()
```

Somethimes you need to share an object between methods; declare `@Shared` field. This es equivalent to initializing the field at the very beginning of the `setupSpec()` method.
```groovy
@Shared res = new VeryExpensiveResource()
```

Static field should only for constants.
```groovy
static final PI = 3.141592654
```
